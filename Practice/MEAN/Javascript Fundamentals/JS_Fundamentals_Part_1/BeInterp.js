/*
Problem #1 Solution
functions and variable declarations hoisted to the top!
Everything else left in the original order.
firstFunc was never invoked, so first_variable after it was set to "Yipee I was first" remains "Yipee I was first".
*/
var first_variable;
function firstFunc(){
  first_variable = "Not anymore!!!";
  console.log(first_variable);
}
console.log(first_variable); // no data has been assigned to first_variable, so shows as console logs undefined.
first_variable = "Yipee I was first!";
console.log(first_variable); // Yipee I was first was assigned to first_variable, so that is what is logged.

/*
Problem #2 Solution
*/
var food; // Declare an outer scope food variable
function eat() {
  var food;
  food = "half-chicken";
  console.log(food); // half-chicken console.log, since there is a LOCAL food
  food = "gone";       // CAREFUL! LOCAL food is set to gone
  console.log(food); // LOCAL food is logged ('gone')l
}
food = "Chicken"; //outer food is set to "chicken"
eat(); // eat is invoked and the half_chicken and gone are logged (the local foods!)
console.log(food); // outer food is logged('chicken')
 /*
 Problem #3 Solution
 */
var new_word; //outer scope new_word variable
function lastFunc(){
  new_word = 'old'; // still references the outer scope new_word variable
}
new_word = "NEW!";
console.log(new_word); //lastFunc wasn't invoked so console.log's "New"
